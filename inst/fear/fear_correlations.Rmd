Now we should look at which of the variables that correlate with our fear index also correlate with each other.

```{r}
bin_bin <- function(data,var1,var2) {
  v1 <- data[data[,var1] < 1000 & data[,var2] < 1000,var1]
  v2 <- data[data[,var1] < 1000 & data[,var2] < 1000,var2]
  ct <- table(v1,v2)
  ft <- fisher.test(ct)
  c(ft$p.value,ft$estimate)
}
hnd_bin <- c('vb2','q10a','q14','ur','sexi','prot3')
for (x in hnd_bin) {
  for (y in hnd_bin[-1:-which(hnd_bin==x)]) {
    res <- bin_bin(lapop.2014.HND,x,y)
    if (res[1] < 0.01) {
      print(paste(x,y,res[1],res[2]))
    }
  }
}
```

So there are negative relationships between:

* `vb2` and `q14`: Voters less likely to plan to leave 
* `ur` and `sexi`: More female interviewers in urban areas

And positive relationships between:

* `q10a` and `q14`: Remittance receivers more likely to plan to leave
* `q10a` and `ur`: Remittance receivers more urban
* `q14` and `ur`: Urban people more likely to leave

Now, correlate binary and continuous variables:

```{r}
bin_cont <- function(data,bvar,cvar) {
  b <- data[data[,bvar] < 1000 & data[,cvar] < 1000,bvar]
  b <- b - min(b) # convert to 0-1 scale
  c <- data[data[,bvar] < 1000 & data[,cvar] < 1000,cvar]  
  tt <- t.test(c[b==0],c[b==1])
  c(tt$p.value,tt$estimate[2]-tt$estimate[1])
}
hnd_cont <- c('ed','for6','pol1','per4','sd3new2','mil1','aoj12','q12','ico2',
              'pole2n','eff1','ing4')
for (x in hnd_bin) {
  for (y in hnd_cont) {
    res <- bin_cont(lapop.2014.HND,x,y)
    if (res[1] < 0.01) {
      print(paste(x,y,res[1],res[2]))
    }
  }
}
```

Negative correlations:

* `vb2` and `q12`: Voters have more children
* `q10a` and `ed`: Educated people receive more remittances
* `q14` and `ed`: Educated people plan to leave
* `q14` and `sd3new2`: People more dissatisfied with schools plan to leave
* `ur` and `ed`: Urban people more educated
* `ur` and `per4`: Urban people have anxious personalities
* `ur` and `aoj12`: Urban people less confident that guilty are punished
* `sexi` and `for6`: People with male interviewers find China more influential

Positive correlations:

* `vb2` and `pol1`: Voters more interested in politics
* `prot3` and `pol1`: Protesters more interested in politics
* `q14` and `pol1`: People interested in politics plan to leave
* `q14` and `q12`: People with fewer children plan to leave
* `ur` and `for6`: Urban people consider China more influential
* `ur` and `q12`: Urban people have fewer children
* `ur` and `ico2`: More National Police patrols in urban neighborhoods
* `sexi` and `aoj12`: People with male interviewers more convinced that guilty are punished

Finally, let's correlate the continuous variables with each other:

```{r}
cont_cont <- function(data,var1,var2) {
  v1 <- data[data[,var1] < 1000 & data[,var2] < 1000,var1]
  v2 <- data[data[,var1] < 1000 & data[,var2] < 1000,var2]
  reg <- lm(v1~v2)
  summary(reg)$coefficients[2,c(1,4)]
}
for (x in hnd_cont) {
  for (y in hnd_cont[-1:-which(hnd_cont==x)]) {
    res <- cont_cont(lapop.2014.HND,x,y)
    if (res[2] < 0.01) {
      print(paste(x,y,res[2],res[1]))
    }
  }
}
```

Negative correlations:

* `ed` and `for6`: Educated people find China more influential
* `ed` and `pol`: Educated people more interested in politics
* `ed` and `q12`: Educated people have fewer children
* `ed` and `ico2`: Educated people get more National Police patrols
* `for6` and `ing4`: People who see Chinese influence prefer democracy
* `pol1` and `mil1`: People interested in politics have a higher opinion of military
* `pol1` and `eff1`: People interested in politics think leaders are interested
* `sd3new2` and `mil1`: People satisfied with schools have a high opinion of military
* `sd3new2` and `eff1`: People satisfied with schools think leaders are interested
* `sd3new2` and `ing4`: People satisfied with schools like democracy
* `mil1` and `aoj12`: People with a high opinion of the military also trust the judiciary
* `mil1` and `ico2`: People with lots of National Police patrols think highly of the military
* `mil1` and `pole2n`: People who love the police also love the military
* `aoj12` and `eff1`: People who think their leaders care also believe the guilty are punished
* `ico2` and `ing4`: People with lots of National Police patrols prefer democracy
* `pole2n` and `eff1`: People who think their leaders care like the police
* `pole2n` and `ing4`: People who like the police like democracy

Positive correlations:

* `ed` and `aoj12`: More educated people don't think the guilty are punished
* `pol1` and `aoj12`: People interested in politics do think the guilty are punished
* `per4` and `pole2n`: Anxious people dislike the police
* `sd3new2` and `aoj12`: People who are satisfied with schools also think the guilty are punished
* `sd3new2` and `ico2`: People who get lots of National Police patrols are satisfied with schools
* `sd3new2` and `pole2n`: People who like the schools like the cops
* `mil1` and `eff1`: People who think their leaders care also think highly of the military
* `mil1` and `ing4`: People who think highly of the military also like democracy
* `aoj12` and `ico2`: People who get lots of National Police patrols think the guilty are punished
* `aoj12` and `pole2n`: People who think the guilty are punished like the police
* `ico2` and `pole2n`: People who get lots of police patrols love the police
* `eff1` and `ing4`: People who think their leaders don't care disapprove of democracy

This seems to point to a coherent set of beliefs -- high levels of trust in the military, police, schools, and political leaders all seem to go together.

Now this can really get interesting -- we're prepared to look at multiple regressions. The goal here is to *invalidate* correlations; we want to rule out as many as we can. 

Let's start with an easy one: I really don't believe that people are afraid of crime because they think China is influential. Perception of Chinese influence (`for6`) correlates with urbanization (`ur`), education (`ed`), preference for democracy (`ing4`), and having a male interviewer (`sexi`).

```{r}
hnd <- lapop.2014.HND
hnd[hnd > 5000] <- NA
hnd$fear_idx <- fear_hnd
summary(lm(fear_hnd ~ hnd$for6 + hnd$ur))
```

So, when we take urbanization into account, China-watchers are no more afraid of crime than other people at the same level of urbanization.

What if we just toss in everything?

```{r}
summary(lm(fear_hnd ~ hnd$ur + hnd$vb2 + hnd$q10a + hnd$q14 + hnd$sexi + 
             hnd$prot3 + hnd$ed + hnd$for6 + hnd$pol1 + hnd$per4 + 
             hnd$sd3new2 + hnd$mil1 + hnd$aoj12 + hnd$q12 + hnd$ico2 + 
             hnd$pole2n +hnd$eff1 + hnd$ing4))
```

With a strict (p < 0.01) criterion, the only significant correlations left are urbanization, male interviewers, anxious personalities, dissatisfaction with schools, infrequent National Police patrols, and dissatisfaction with police.

In hindsight, it probably wasn't necessary to calculate all of those pairwise correlations, because adding all of them tells us what we really needed to know -- which variables really have an impact on our fear index. Of course there's a risk in adding too many variables -- whenever a variable has `NA` values, those responses get omitted from the multiple regression. With too many variables we'll end up throwing away too much data.

```{r}
nrow(na.omit(hnd[,c(hnd_bin,hnd_cont)])) / nrow(hnd)
```

We've still got about 75% of our data included in that multiple regression.

While we're at it, let's look at unordered categorical variables:

```{r}
categ <- function(f,x,categ) {
  # For a data from f with a continuous variable 'x' and an unordered 
  # categorical variable 'categ', test whether the value of x is 
  # significantly higher or lower for each value of categ than for the
  # rest of the population. Do this using a two-sample t-test.
  result <- data.frame(var=character(),val=integer(),pval=double(),
                       mean=double(),othermean=double())
  for(q in unique(na.omit(f[,categ]))) {
    if(sum(f[,categ]==q,na.rm=TRUE) > 1) {
      yes <- f[f[,categ]==q,x]
      no <- f[f[,categ]!=q,x]
      if (sum(!is.na(no)) < 2) return()
      tt <- t.test(yes,no,na.rm=TRUE)
      if (tt$p.value < 0.01) {
        newrow <- data.frame(var=categ,val=q,pval=tt$p.value,
                         mean=tt$estimate[[1]],
                         othermean=tt$estimate[[2]])
        result <- rbind(result,newrow)
      }
    }
  }
  result
}
unordered_vars <- c('a4','vic2','vic2aa','vb3n','vb4new','vb101','vb11',

             'ocup1a_1','q11n_2')

for (x in cat_var) {
  s <- lm(fear_hnd ~ hnd$ur + hnd$vb2 + hnd$q10a + hnd$q14 + hnd$sexi + 
             hnd$prot3 + hnd$ed + hnd$for6 + hnd$pol1 + hnd$per4 + 
             hnd$sd3new2 + hnd$mil1 + hnd$aoj12 + hnd$q12 + hnd$ico2 + 
             hnd$pole2n +hnd$eff1 + hnd$ing4 + hnd[,x])
  res <- summary(s)$coefficient[nrow(summary(s)$coefficient),c(4,1)]
  if (res[1] < 0.01) {
    print(paste(c(x,res)))
  }
}
```

With a parsimonious p < 0.01, only `vic2aa_4` is significant. At the p < 0.05 level, `ocup4a_3==3` (job seekers) and `vb11==407` (Anti-corruption party (PAC) adherents) also look interesting.

```{r}
summary(lm(fear_hnd ~ hnd$ur + hnd$vb2 + hnd$q10a + hnd$q14 + hnd$sexi + 
             hnd$prot3 + hnd$ed + hnd$for6 + hnd$pol1 + hnd$per4 + 
             hnd$sd3new2 + hnd$mil1 + hnd$aoj12 + hnd$q12 + hnd$ico2 + 
             hnd$pole2n +hnd$eff1 + hnd$ing4 + hnd$vic2aa_4))
```

Because `vic2aa_4` has `NA` values for all respondents who *weren't* victims in the last 12 months, it ruins most of my other correlations. We do see, however, that out of the population of self-identified victims, those with male interviewers are significantly more fearful.

Looking forward to the social media analyses, it seems that frustration with schools and police, urbanization, anxiety, unemployment, and PAC support could be interesting avenues to explore.
