## Key Research & Programmatic question

The main focus of the study is organized around 3 linked questions that can influence population movement mitigation program:

 1. What influence the intention to move to another country: push & pull factor? How different measurement of perception are correlated: protection-related push factor vs economic pull factor? Are economic conditions sufficient to motivate the intention to move? Resources allocation to protection intervention vs economic support

 2. Can we identify displacement hot-spots? What make those hospots specific? Geographic targeting and area-based approach for service delivery design

 3. Are there specific profiles that are intending vs those who do not intend to move? Household targeting for cash intervention

The analysis is based on longitudinal analysis of [Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP)](http://datasets.americasbarometer.org/database/index.php) survey from 2004 to 2018 (_i.e. 8 survey dataset per country_). The [AmericasBarometer](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/about-americasbarometer.php) is a periodic study of 34 countries in the Western Hemisphere, with stratified nationally representative samples drawn in each country, a common questionnaire core, and country-specific modules. It is the only scientifically rigorous comparative survey of democratic values and behaviors that covers all independent countries in North, Central, and South America, as well as a significant number of countries in the Caribbean. The Americas Barometer measures attitudes, evaluations, experiences, and behavior in the Americas using national probability samples of voting-age adults. Standardizing methods and a common core questionnaire permit valid comparisons across countries and over time on topics including the economy, rule of law, state capacity, trust in institutions, individual values, corruption, security, and more.

Each country survey is implemented based on a national probability design. In some cases, oversamples are collected to allow precise analysis of opinion within sub-national regions.
